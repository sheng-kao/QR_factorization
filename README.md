# QR_decomposition
the hardware design for QR factorization using cordic algorithm;

this is a classroom project form nchu vlsi_dsp class;

the detail algorithm process is describe in the VLSI_HW2.docx file;

and the vcode and testbench is put in design_data  folder;

synthsis result is put in run folder;

tcl file is put in scripts folder;

This design is currently limited to 8*4 QR factorization;

change the input port data delivery method can realize n*4 QR factorization;
